# PowerLineMC
This repository contains a single file, which is a Modelica package.
The package has the purpose of allowing simulation of power lines with Modelica, using Modelica Standard Library, starting from the geometry of conductors.
A complete description of the package, as well as the rationale behing it, is descripted in the paper subitted to SoftwareX, named: "Open source modelling of power lines using Modelica language"
